                <p id="blurbformatting">Let that sink in is a fantastic example of the puns that can be made from modern ways of speaking. The person in this forum post was discussing something deep and philisophical. The first user reply is a pun that undermines the seriousness of the previous post and that extreme disconnect between these two people is the root of the joke. The sugar on top of it is the image they created to go with it.</p>
